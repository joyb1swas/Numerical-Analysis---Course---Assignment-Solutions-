Q1. How does the estimate change with larger N?
= The estimate change is increasing with larger N. When n is 1000 the value is closer to π, but when n is increases the value becomes much closer to π.

Q2. How close does it get to actual π?
= It depends on the value of x,y as we generating random axis pair so the difference if 3 trial of N is different but the estimation is get pretty close to π. After checking different estimation the difference when n is 1000 = ±0.1 and when n is 10000/100000 = ±0.03/±0.01. It might be different as we said we consider (x,y) as random axis pair so the difference is different.
