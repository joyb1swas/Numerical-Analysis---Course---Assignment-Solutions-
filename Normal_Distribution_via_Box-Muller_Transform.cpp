Q1. Does your distribution resemble a bell curve?
= Yes
Q2. What is the mean and stddev? Are the mean and stddev close to 0 and 1?
= The mean and stddev are known as mean and standard deviation.
Yes, they are close to 0 and 1 respectively.
Since we working with random variables so the answer is not accurate all the
time it varies because of random inputs,
but after running multiple times we are seeing that the mean and standard
deviation are close to 0 and 1 and its different all the time.
